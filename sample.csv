2023-01-04,ASR,"Airport stocks are rarely brought to the attention of retail investors. Yet, they can be marvelous investments due to their one-of-a-kind features. In this article, we are looking at three airport stocks whose unique qualities position them well for a potential takeoff in 2023. Particularly, Mexico-based Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste ( NYSE: ASR ), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico ( NYSE: PAC ), and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte ( NYSE: OMAB ) have been experiencing improvements in their financials over the past several quarters following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their shares trading near all-time high levels after outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) in the past year, their unique traits and attractive valuations could imply further upside in 2023, even though analysts don't expect upside from these stocks (see below). What Makes Airport Stocks Attractive Investments? Airports are totally unique assets that come with multiple attractive and investor-friendly characteristics. Let's go through three of the most significant traits that benefit airport stocks. 1. High-Quality, Diversified Revenues One of the most attractive characteristics of airports is that they enjoy high-quality revenues via multiple sources. Firstly, airports sign multi-year leases with airlines. These leases are usually long-term agreements that can provide a steady and predictable source of cash flow for the airport. Further, airports generate cash flows from a variety of other sources, including concessions, parking, and real estate rentals. Airlines are usually big, reputable businesses. Most are publicly traded, with transparent financials, while airports are incredibly critical for them to operate. Therefore, airports have minimal risks when it comes to collecting their rightful fees. Additionally, whether it comes from collecting car parking revenues, rental income from businesses operating within the airport, or other fees, these are high-margin cash flows with minimal operating costs. Airports provide the space and overall infrastructure but don't actually go through the hassle of operating these businesses directly, which makes for a great business model. 2. Growing Travel Demand The COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on the travel industry between 2020 and 2021. However, demand for travel has been rebounding, resulting in a growing demand for vacation and commercial trips. Flights generated revenues of just $36.4 billion in the U.S. in 2020, a massive drop from their pre-pandemic figure of $108.4 billion in 2019. With demand for travel rebounding strongly, flights are expected to generate revenues of $130.9 billion in 2023 - a new all-time high. Additionally, revenues are expected to grow by a CAGR of 3% through 2027. This means that airports are likely to be negotiating more leases with airlines, organically benefiting from the industry's growth without additional efforts. 3. Limited Investable Opportunities Finally, airport stocks benefit from the fact that there are only a few investable opportunities in the space. This makes them highly-attractive assets. This comes in two forms. Firstly, most airports around the world are wholly or partly owned by governments. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Denver International Airport, for instance, are owned and operated by The City of Los Angeles and the City &amp; County of Denver, respectively. Thus, investors have no opportunity to invest in the bulk of the world's airports. Secondly, airports are highly regulated and have essentially no competition in their respective markets. It's not like a potential competitor can go and build an airport next to an existing one and compete. Besides, they require enormous capital expenditures to contrast. In any case, this is also another reason why investors have very limited options when it comes to gaining exposure to airports, which makes the existing publicly-traded stocks like ASR, PAC, and OMAB highly scarce and attractive assets. Takeaway: Why are These Airport Stocks Worth Considering? Besides the attractive characteristics attached to airport stocks, as just discussed, ASR, PAC, and OMAB have multiple charming features on their own, which makes them attractive investments worth considering. Firstly, they are the biggest publicly-traded companies in the space, with exposure to multiple assets. I mentioned that airports benefit from diversified cash flows; ASR, PAC, and OMAB, each own nine, 12, and 13 airports, respectively. Further, the companies have a consistent history of generating sustainable profits and returning capital to shareholders due to their multiples qualities, as mentioned earlier. OMAB stock financials The combination of growing profits which has resulted in share price gains and hefty dividends has resulted in ASR, PAC, and OMAB stocks recording total returns of 353.2%, 322.2%, and 181.6%, respectively, over the past decade. Regarding their dividends, it's worth noting that while ASR, PAC, and OMAB do not have consistent track records, they do tend to grow their payouts in line with their profits. Unless you really value consistency when it comes to dividend growth, they should still serve adequately when it comes to growing your income over time. Finally, despite their shares trading near all-time high levels, all three stocks appear to be quite attractively priced. Specifically, ASR, PAC, and OMAB are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 13.8x, 14.5x, and 16.4x, respectively. These multiples are below their historical averages. Regardless, I find these multiples very cheap, considering the positive qualities attached to airport stocks. Thus, I believe all three stocks have strong prospects to keep flying higher through 2023. Disclosure",Stock Commentary,0

2023-01-09,IGIC,"""Ready to take a trip abroad and scope out some investable brands in far-away lands? As we embark on a new year, it's time to look beyond local businesses, as some of the most intriguing trading opportunities involve international stocks. Granted, this will require extra due diligence as cross-border investing can entail political and economic complexities that are literally foreign to many retail traders. The rewards could certainly be worth the extra effort, however, as the following top-tier international stocks have """"bargain"""" written all over them - and great deals are always worth a look, regardless of their physical location. Let's take a look, then, at CPG, IGIC, and ASML, three worthy international stock picks for 2023. Crescent Point Energy ( NYSE:CPG) Let's start our journey abroad to the Great White North, also known as Canada, where Crescent Point Energy drills for oil and natural gas. While Crescent Point Energy gets light, sweet crude oil out of the ground, investors can collect some sweet distributions as the company has a 3.1% dividend yield on a trailing-12-month basis and a 4.4% yield on a forward basis. Bargain hunters should pay close attention, as Crescent Point Energy's P/E ratio of 2.3x is absolutely rock-bottom. It's entirely conceivable that CPG stock could revisit its $10 from the summer of 2022, especially if oil and natural gas prices rise. Plus, Crescent Point is an aggressive driller that expects to generate annual average production of 134,000 to 138,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2023, so feel free to consider this Canadian energy up-and-comer. What is the Price Target for CPG Stock? CPG has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Crescent Point Energy stock price target of $10.97 implies 59.3% upside potential. International General Insurance Holdings ( NASDAQ:IGIC) Registered in Bermuda, International General Insurance Holdings is ready to insure almost anything -- energy, property, general aviation, marine cargo, professional indemnity, and even political violence. This is a truly international insurer, with operations ranging from Bermuda to London, Malta to Dubai, Casablanca, and beyond. Again, I've handpicked a high-yield, low-valuation prospective winner for you. While International General Insurance Holdings' 2.75% annual dividend yield is tempting, the company's 5.7x P/E ratio is practically irresistible. Furthermore, International General Insurance Holdings demonstrated across-the-board year-over-year improvements in gross written premiums, net premiums earned, profit for the period, and EPS during 2022's third quarter - a solid financial performance for this international pick. What is the Price Target for IGIC Stock? IGIC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on a single Buy rating assigned in the past three months. The average International General Insurance Holdings stock price target of $10 implies 21.5% upside potential. ASML Holding ( NASDAQ:ASML) ASML Holding hails from the Netherlands, and it's not exactly a microchip maker. Rather, this Dutch company creates equipment that can be used to design and manufacture microchips. It's an indirect way to wager on a global recovery in the chip market - and with ASML Holding, you can park your capital in a business that usually beats analysts' quarterly consensus EPS estimates. The 0.95% trailing dividend yield (1.17% forward yield) that ASML Holding pays isn't the main selling point, but it does sweeten the deal. More important is the company's long-term growth story, as ASML Holding envisions sales growth from €18.6 billion euros in 2021 to €44 billion - €60 billion euros in 2030. Moreover, as JPMorgan ( NYSE:JPM ) analyst Sandeep Deshpande points out, ASML Holding has a distinct advantage as the """"sole supplier"""" of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) tools for the microprocessor manufacturing industry. Clearly, this is an international niche-market mover that tech investors should put on their radars. What is the Price Target for ASML Stock? ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average ASML Holding stock price target of $686.60 implies 10.5% upside potential. Conclusion: Should You Consider International Stocks in 2023? Crescent Point Energy, International General Insurance Holdings, and ASML Holding are about as diverse as three companies can be. Yet, they all provide compelling reasons for prospective investors to think outside the box and take a chance on some interesting foreign businesses. All three of them pay dividends and offer growth potential for this year and the years to come. With this in mind, there's only one conclusion to make: international stocks are definitely worth looking into in 2023, and CPG, IGIC, and ASML could be big winners for open-minded financial traders.

2023-01-10,FPI,"Farmland has long been regarded as a valuable asset, both for its ability to produce food and as a potential investment. With the global population expected to continue growing, the demand for food is set to keep increasing over time. Farmland also harbors several qualities due to food's essential nature, especially since the availability of crops has been disputed following the war in Ukraine, which is one of the major produce exporters. Overall, due to its critical nature, the value of farmland is quite durable, and it even gradually appreciates over time, which makes it a great asset to hold for capital preservation. Gladstone Land Corporation ( NASDAQ: LAND ) and Farmland Partners ( NYSE: FPI ) are the only two pure farmland plays that are publically traded. With uncertainty in the markets still fuming, investing in these two stocks could be an excellent way to preserve your capital and, in the meantime, enjoy a predictable stream of dividends. In this article, I will discuss why Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners could be fitting investments for the current market environment, including their capacity to act as an inflation hedge and their tendency to generate low-volatility returns. Farmland is a Hedge Against Inflation Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners can be an excellent hedge against inflation. This is a great advantage to boast these days as inflation remains quite elevated, even if it has somewhat eased lately. Their inflation-hedge quality is due to several reasons. First, the prices of agricultural commodities tend to increase with inflation. As the cost of producing these goods goes up, the prices that farmers can charge for their crops also increase. This means that the value of farmland, which is utilized to produce these crops, increases with inflation. Farmland is also a tangible asset, and tangible asset values often rise in line with inflation. This is because as the purchasing power of money declines, investors will look for assets that are likely to retain their value in order to protect their wealth. With Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners owning such physical assets, their stock prices should not experience the same volatility as other financial assets. To give you a frame of reference, from 1980 through 2021, the Fresh Fruits &amp; Vegetables segment of the Food &amp; Beverages category rose by 345%, which was 1.6x more than the gain in the overall Annual Food &amp; Beverages CPI over the same period. Not only does this greatly illustrate that farmland can be a great inflation hedge, but the fact this data spans more than 40 years solidifies the validity of this argument. The Key to Low-Volatility Returns Due to their unique characteristics, including their nature as an inflation hedge, Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners can provide low-volatility returns and predictable dividend streams over the long run. In fact, U.S. farmland has experienced lower volatility than both the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index while also exhibiting a low correlation to other major asset classes. To provide some background, the standard deviation of 20-year returns between 2002 and 2021 in the farmland index was 7.4% against the S&amp;P 500's 17.1% and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index's 19.9%. Thus, farmland stocks can be great investment vehicles for generating low-volatility returns. In that respect, both Gladstone Land's and Farmland Partners' dividends are well covered and should provide a predictable stream of income for investors, further enhancing the case for low-volatility returns. Farmland Partners is expected to generate FFO/share (funds from operations per share, an earnings metric used by REITs) of $0.32 for the year, covering its $0.24 annual dividend comfortably. Gladstone Land is expected to deliver FFO/share of $0.74, also covering its $0.55 annual dividend quite sufficiently. Additionally, it's worth noting that Gladstone Land's dividends are paid monthly, adding to the predictability of the stock's total returns. Is LAND Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, Gladstone Land has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on three Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. At $27.25, the average Gladstone Land price target implies 44.4% upside potential. Is FPI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? As far as Farmland Partners goes, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on two unanimous Holds assigned in the past three months. At $14.25, the average Farmland Partners price target implies 13.9% upside potential. Takeaway - Great for Capital Preservation, but Expect Thin Returns Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners should serve well those looking to preserve their capital via holding stocks that own tangible assets that appreciate in value over time. They can be ideal low-volatility holdings during the current uncertain environment. Nevertheless, I would have minor return expectations ahead. Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners yield as little as 2.9% and 1.9%, while earnings and dividends are likely to grow negligibly over the long term. Farmland benefits during inflationary periods, and its value appreciates over the long run. However, this is a mature industry with no outer growth factors. Due to their unique qualities, investors also tend to overvalue these assets. Gladstone Land and Farmland Partners trade at ~25.5x and ~40.0x their projected FFOs for the year. Their rich valuations could also limit investors' future total returns. Disclosure",General News | Opinion,0

2023-01-11,BIOR,"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

2023-01-12,OPAL,"Risk and reward should be on every investor’s mind right now, and for good reason. The risks of market investing are piling up; according to Nadia Lovell, senior US equity strategist with UBS, we’re almost certain to see a recession hit this year. The chance of a hard downturn, in her view, is somewhat mitigated by a hot labor market and an excess in consumer savings ? but even so, Lovell believes that the S&amp;P 500 will drop to 3,700 this year before rebounding to 4,000 by year’s end. Lovell sees two drivers pushing the market into recession, pointing her finger at both a corporate earnings contraction and the rapid shift of the Federal Reserve to a policy of restrictive monetary tightening. “We think that there's more pain to come on the earnings side,” she says, and goes on to add, “It's going to be difficult for the economy to grow with such a massive change in the Fed Funds rate in 10 months. And so we find it difficult to see that we get earnings growth this year. And earnings are likely to contract at least 4%.” Adding additional grimness to that picture, Lovell is also predicting a higher unemployment rate, which she states is inevitable in a recessionary environment. Getting down to brass tacks, Lovell makes some specific sector recommendations for investors, to find the most attractive balance of risk and reward. She points to energy and healthcare stocks as solid choices, defensive plays that find wide endorsement among investment professionals. Energy stocks should do well as long as demand stays strong and supply limited, while healthcare stocks combine affordable valuations and sound growth potential. The stock analysts at UBS are taking Lovell’s evaluation as a starting point, and picking out individual stocks from these two sectors. We can dip into the TipRanks database for the latest details on some of these picks; here are two of them, with comments from the UBS analysts. OPAL Fuels Inc. ( OPAL) We’ll start in the energy sector, where OPAL Fuels is a leader in the renewable natural gas (RNG) segment. The company operates on both the production and distribution ends, capturing potentially harmful methane emissions and converting it into low-carbon-intensity RNG. The renewable fuel can be used to replace diesel and other fossil fuels. This company lists several ‘green economy’ advantages attributable to its RNG product, starting with savings in cost. Replacing diesel fuel with RNG can save transport fleet operators up to 50% in fuel costs every year. In addition, RNG production can be used to reduce methane emissions from landfills or dairy farms, and can be used to increase hydrogen production as another alternate fuel. OPAL is a newcomer to the public trading markets, having gone public in July of 2022 through a SPAC transaction, a business combination with ArcLight Clean Transition Corporation II. The transaction was approved on July 15, and the OPAL ticker started trading on July 22. In its most recent quarterly report, for 3Q22, OPAL showed a top line of $66.6 million, for a 41% year-over-year gain. This was derived from quarterly production of 0.6 million MMBtu of RNG, a y/y production increase of 50%; from sales of 7.4 million GGEs (gasoline gallon equivalents) of RNG, up 17% y/y; and deliveries of 30.7 million GGEs, which was up 33% from the prior year quarter. The company is guiding toward full-year 2022 RNG production of 2.2 million to 2.3 million MMBtu. OPAL is working to meet that goal by expanding its production capacity, and earlier this month the company announced the commencement of full operations at the first landfill gas to RNG facility in the state of Florida. The new facility is expected to produce up to 5 million GGEs per year going forward. In his coverage of OPAL for UBS, William Grippin highlights why investors should lean into this name right now. He writes, “We expect OPAL to grow adj. EBITDA by ~55% CAGR through 2026E, underpinned by a 4-yr construction backlog of renewable natural gas (RNG) projects. In our view, OPAL offers a favorable risk/reward skew with the current ~11x 2024 UBSe EV/EBITDA multiple not fully reflecting the growth potential of OPAL's project backlog. Key milestones over the next 12 months include: 1) On-time commissioning of 4 out of 7 currently in-construction projects, 2) conversion of 4-5 pipeline projects to in-construction status, 3) Establishment of final 2023 renewable fuel volume obligations by the EPA.” Looking forward from this stance, Grippin gives OPAL shares a Buy rating with a price target of $13 to indicate his confidence in ~86% upside on the one-year time frame. (To watch Grippin’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap RNG firm has picked up 5 recent reviews from the Street’s analysts and these are all positive, backing up a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently selling for $7 and its average price target, standing at $13.75, implies a robust 96% upside potential over the coming year. (See OPAL stock forecast ) Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. ( SRPT) For the second UBS pick we’ll switch to the healthcare sector. Sarepta is a biopharma company that has scored a ‘hat trick,’ having a comprehensive product and research lineup that features drug candidates in the discovery and clinical stages of development, as well as approved products in the commercialization stages. The company takes a gene editing approach to biopharmaceuticals, and is working on treatments for genetically-based disease conditions with a particular focus on muscular dystrophy. On the commercial side, Sarepta has three approved gene therapy products on the market for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These three drugs, Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, and Amondys 45, brought in a total of $207.8 million in product revenues for 3Q22 - this was up 24% year-over-year, and made up the bulk of the company’s $230.3 million total top line. The additional revenues came from collaboration payments on pipeline drug candidates. The company also just released preliminary Q4 and full-year product revenue results; net product revenues for the quarter are expected to reach ~$235.5 million, amounting to a 32% y/y increase while revenues for the full-year are expected to reach $843.3 million, above guidance of $825 to $840 million. Turning to the pipeline, the most important program to note is SRP-9001 being developed together with Roche. This drug candidate is a potential treatment for ambulant patients with Duchenne; based on positive clinical trial results, the company this past September submitted the Biologics License Application to the FDA, and is seeking accelerated approval. A PDUFA date has been set for May 29. At the same time, Sarepta is also running the EMBARK clinical trial ? a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SRP-9001, that is fully enrolled and dosed ? and has proposed this trial as a confirmatory study to support accelerated approval. Covering Sarepta for UBS is analyst Colin Bristow, who sees potential regulatory and clinical trial catalysts in the company’s late-stage research pipeline. Bristow says of Sarepta, “Our view is that accelerated approval for SRP-9001 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) by the May 29 PDUFA is highly likely (we increased our Prob of Approval to 85% from 60%) - we believe SRPT has sufficient data to support the use of shortened/truncated dystrophin (formerly known as microdystrophin) expression as a surrogate biomarker of function. Additionally, the early involvement of CBER director Peter Marks and Neurology head Billy Dunn in the regulatory process are soft positive indicators of a favorable outcome, in our view (supported by our regulatory KOL discussion).” These comments fully support Bristow’s Buy rating on SRPT shares, and his $158 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~31%. (To watch Bristow’s track record, click here) A healthcare stock with as many shots on goals as Sarepta ? the commercialized medications, the late-stage pipeline, the pre-clinical tracks ? is sure to attract investor and analyst interest, and SRPT shares have 17 recent reviews on file. These include 14 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has an average price target of $148.88, suggesting ~25% upside from the current trading price of $120.13.

2023-01-13,MDWD,"""The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures showed that inflation is still easing, having dropped for the 6 th consecutive month. The CPI for December rose by 6.5% from the same period a year ago and fell by 0.1% compared to November, thereby meeting Street expectations. There are still areas of concern, though, such as services inflation, which might put a spanner in the works for investors hoping the latest readout will cause the Fed to put the brakes on its rate-hiking endeavors. Additionally, there are still plenty of concerns about the prospect of a recession. However, one financial expert thinks these are overblown. Investment strategist Ed Yardeni recently said the “outlook for the world economy is actually improving.” In fact, Yardeni thinks the bottom for the stock market has been in since October 12. “That was the end of the bear market,” he says, “and we‘re back in a bull market.” If Yardeni is right, then now is likely a propitious time for investors to buy in. With this in mind, we’ve dipped into the TipRanks database and found two names that are expected to push higher in the months ahead ? by the order of 80% or more. And the cherry on top - all three are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s see why the analysts are so keen on these names right now. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. ( RARE ) We'll start with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, a biotech company focused on developing and bringing to market treatments for rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. The company has several products on the market, including Crysvita, a therapy for X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and Dojolvi, a prescription medicine that treats long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD). Additionally, the company boasts a diverse clinical pipeline based around three rare disease research paths: bone/endocrine; metabolics; and CNS/muscle. These include UX111, an AAV9 gene therapy Ultragenyx, which is indicated to treat Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA). Based on interim data from the ongoing, pivotal Transpher A study, the company anticipates talking to the FDA in 1H23 regarding the filing route. There’s also the Phase 3 study of DTX401 taking place. This is an AAV8 gene therapy designed to treat glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a). Then there’s GTX-102, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for Angelman syndrome that the company procured via last year’s GeneTx acquisition. An update from the expansion cohorts of a Phase 1/2 study is anticipated this year. This is the drug that H.C. Wainwright analyst Ed Acre thinks investors are most focused on, believing it to be the “main value driver for the stock.” The shares lost 46% during 2022, and Acre thinks that is “due partly to lingering doubts on GTX-102's safety and how to interpret data in very small ‘n’ and across multiple assessments.” “However,” the 5-star analyst went on to explain, “we believe the determination of the optimal dose, with ‘substantial data’ on GTX-102 (likely in terms of both sample size and duration post-treatment) expected next year (2023) could represent a major de-risking event, which we anticipate could occur before key competitive readouts from ION582 and rugonersen.” “Despite the unflattering stock chart,” the analyst concluded, “as we look across the broad pipeline, we see substantial value-creation potential that creates an excellent entry-point, in our view.” To this end, Acre rates RARE shares a Buy, backed by an $82 price target. This figure reflects his belief in ~85% upside heading into next year. (To watch Acre’s track record, click here) It’s not as if Acre is alone in his bullish take. With 11 Buy ratings and just 1 Hold, the consensus view here is a Strong Buy. At 86.58, the average target represents one-year upside of ~95%. (See RARE stock forecast ) MediWound Ltd. ( MDWD ) The next stock in our sights is MediWound, a biopharmaceutical company that leverages its enzymatic technology platform to develop next-generation therapies for severe burns, wounds, and tissue repair. The big recent news on the Mediwound front is the one all biotechs hope to achieve. At the end of December, the company announced that the FDA has given its nod of approval for NexoBrid, the company’s solution for the removal of eschar in adults with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness thermal burns. The U.S. commercial launch is expected to take place in 2Q23, and the approval triggers a $7.5 million milestone payment from Vericel. NexoBrid is already approved in 43 countries. As for the pipeline, the company is also working on EscharEx, a topical agent being advanced for the debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds. The treatment had positive results in Phase 2 studies, and once discussions with the regulators are done, the company intends on initiating a pivotal Phase 3 trial in 1H23. There’s also MW005, a treatment of low-risk Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). Mediwound recently announced positive data from its Phase I/II study and patients are still being enrolled, with more results anticipated this year. Maxim analyst Michael Okunewitch lays out the bull-case for Mediwound, noting: “We expect revenue for NexoBrid to build, particularly with a U.S. approval, and see this opportunity alone as a valuation catalyst, with the higher value opportunity represented by EscharEx in the ~$2B chronic wound market.” “MediWound has ~$35M in cash on the balance sheet and combined with the $7.5M milestone from partner Vericel, the company should have cash runway into 2025 and be well-positioned to execute on its clinical and commercial strategy to drive value for investors,"""" the analyst added. These comments underpin Okunewitch’s Buy rating, while his $25 price target suggests the shares could surge ~93% over the coming year. (To watch Okunewitch’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, based on Buys only ? 4, in total - the analysts view this stock as a Strong Buy. The forecast calls for one-year gains of a hefty 172%, considering the average target stands at $34.

2023-01-15,PERF,"""Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilized in multiple applications. From image recognition to healthcare, e-commerce to advertising to credit scoring and many other industries - all are making use of AI’s human-like capabilities. And with computing power continuously improving, it is set to get more prevalent over time. One recent example of its impact is ChatGPT ? the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched last November. The tool has quickly caught the public’s imagination with its ability to perform different tasks such as write articles, songs and even write code and its success has only highlighted how AI will keep on impacting our lives. Of course, with any fledgling industry, investors will get an opportunity to buy in and there are publicly traded companies basing their entire value proposition around AI. With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two AI-focused stocks that have the experts singing their praises. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices right now. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) The first AI stock we're looking at is SoundHound AI, a voice assisting specialist. Via speech, its voice AI platform enables consumers to interact with products. This is not some esoteric segment of the market we’re talking about. The company sees a huge TAM (total addressable market) of $160 billion ahead; by 2024, there are expected to be 8 billion voice assistants in use with 75 billion connected devices operating worldwide the following year. SoundHound has some big-name clients on its roster such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Stellantis and Vizio. SoundHound only became a public entity this year, entering the market via the SPAC route back in April. It has been a trial by fire, to say the least. The shares are down by 88% since the debut as SPACs went seriously out of favor in 2022’s bear. Nevertheless, despite worries about the company being able to withstand the tough macro conditions amidst continued losses, it has been posting some impressive growth. In Q3, revenue climbed by 178% YoY to $11.2 million. The company saw a cumulative bookings backlog of $302 million, amounting to a 239% YoY increase - representing a fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth and a company record. In November, the company introduced a new product called Dynamic Interaction, a conversational AI tool that enables businesses to use voice AI technology when servicing customers. Cantor’s Brett Knoblauch thinks it could be a “game-changing technology as it pertains to how humans interact with computers, and more broadly speaking, technology.” “We believe there are numerous use-cases that this technology could be utilized for, with low-hanging fruit being within customer-service settings like restaurants,” the analyst went on to add. “We believe this product 1) further expands upon SOUN's conversational AI advantage; 2) gives us greater visibility into SOUN's revenue trajectory; 3) will accelerate the mix-shift of revenue towards subscription revenue; and 4) expands SOUN's addressable market.” Conveying his confidence, Knoblauch rates SOUN as Overweight (i.e., Buy) and backs it up with a $1.60 price target, implying shares will move ~32% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Knoblauch’s track record, click here) Knoblauch, while bullish on the stock, is somewhat conservative compared to the general Wall Street view here. The average price target is higher than Alexanders, at $3.70, implying a strong upside potential of ~206% from the $1.21 share price. Unsurprisingly, SOUN has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a unanimous 3 Buys. (See SOUN stock forecast ) Perfect Corp ( PERF ) The next AI stock we’ll look at is Perfect Corp, essentially a SaaS company with a twist. The unique selling point is that it offers augmented reality and artificial solutions to the fashion and beauty sectors. So, how does that work? With the use of facial 3D modelling and deep learning tech, the company’s AI/AR makeup and hair solutions allow users to try on makeup and different hairstyles and dyes digitally. Basically, AI-powered virtual try-on offerings. In a world where so much is shifting online and consumers expect engaging experiences catered to their own style, the company is an early mover with a market leading position in this niche. Formed in 2015, some of the world’s most famous cosmetics companies are already on board; Estee Lauder Group, Coty, Kose, LVMH, and Shiseido are all using the solutions. The company has only been on the public markets since the end of last October when it IPOd via the SPAC route; at the end of November, Perfect announced unaudited financial results for the nine months of the year. Driven by an uptick in AR/AI cloud solutions and subscription revenues, total revenue increased by 22.1% year-over-year to $36.2 million, while gross profit rose from $25.6 million in the same period a year ago to $31.1 million. Even better, net income swung dramatically from a net loss of $3.1 million a year ago to $28.5 million. For Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz, that is just one of the reasons that makes Perfect an appealing investment choice. """"The business is a proven disruptor of the beauty industry, has achieved scale, and is profitably growing at a fast rate,"""" the 5-star analyst said. “We think the pedigree, technology vision, strong culture, and industry experience of its CEO and leadership team will set the company up to be a vertical SaaS leader and become a good compounding growth investment… The beauty and fashion markets for AI/AR solutions are early in evolution; PERF is arguably the best growth asset in the categories for investment.” Accordingly, Schwartz rates PERF shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $10 price target implies 12-month growth of ~25%. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, PERF gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

2023-01-20,AKTS,"""Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times. The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking ? but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts. Rick Schafer, from Oppenheimer, holds the #6 ranking out of more than 8,200 stock pros on Wall Street. The 74% success rate of his stock recommendations puts him head and shoulders above his peers ? and his calls generated a 21% average return over the past 12 months. It’s an impressive record, and it makes his stock reviews always worth a second look. So let’s do that. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three of Schafer’s recent picks. These are all Strong Buy equities ? and Schafer sees them gaining over 40% in the coming months. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. ( AKTS) We’ll start in the tech field, where Akoustis Technologies focuses on the development and use of single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These are a vital component of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, a ubiquitous tech in mobile devices ? the smartphones and tablets that are everywhere now. Akoustis designs, builds, and markets lines of BAW RF filters, and is known for its combination of wide filter bandwidth and superior performance. The biggest recent news for Akoustis was the January 4 announcement that it had closed its acquisition of Grinding and Dicing Services, Inc. (GDSI). GDSI, a US-based provider of high-end semiconductor supply chain services, will make it possible for Akoustis to reshore much of its work to the US ? an important advantage, as last year the Biden Administration saw the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress in an effort to repatriate high-tech supply chains at scale. This important acquisition follows the company’s fiscal Q1 report. For the quarter ending on September 30, 2022, Q1 of fiscal year 2023, Akoustis reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company showed $5.6 million at the top line, for a gain of 195% year-over-year. Akoustis finished the quarter with more than $60 million in cash assets, a net loss per diluted share of 33 cents. In his coverage of Akoustis, top analyst Schafer sees the GDSI acquisition as the main point for investors to consider right now, and he describes the benefits it’s likely to bring as being complementary to Akoustis’ overall position. """"GDSI bolsters AKTS backend capabilities and improves scale. Coupled with RFMi, we see a strengthened position in 5G RAN and smartphone. We see potential for multiple expansion as revenue ramps and management executes on WiFi, 5G RAN, and mobile milestones/profitability,"""" Schafer opined. Schafer goes on to rate AKTS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $7 implies a one-year gain of 131% for the stock. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews on record for AKTS, and they all agree that it is a Buy ? making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $3.03 and their $6.33 average price target suggest an upside of ~109% for the next 12 months. ( See AKTS stock forecast ) Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ( VLN) Next up is Valens, a fabless semiconductor chip company; that is, the company designs chips and produces prototypes, and then contracts the large-scale production lines to third-party chip foundries. Valens was the first to develop HDBaseT tech, the industry standard in audio-video chips, and is an industry leader in A-PHY, known for allowing high-speed connectivity via simplified infrastructure. The company’s PHY tech has found numerous applications in automotive technology, and Valens counts such names as Mercedes-Benz and MobileEye among its customer base. Valens entered the public trading markets in September of 2021, and since then the company has recorded a steady increase in its top line revenues. It showed total revenue of $23.1 million in 3Q22, a company record, and up 21% y/y. The company’s GAAP net loss moderated from $8.5 million in 3Q21 to 3Q22’s $5.3 million loss. The automotive business proved to be a driver of the revenue gains, and Valens reported continued expansion of its VA7000 chipset family, an important component of MIPI A-PHY-compliant automotive technologies. These chips are vital to an array of the sensors ? including cameras, radars, and LiDARs ? that are becoming ever more common in modern vehicles. Covering the stock for Oppenheimer, Rick Schafer describes a clear course forward for the company, including a potentially game-changing total addressable market in the automotive sector. “Looking forward, we see accelerated growth led by auto... We see VA6000 chipset content $25/car and $50/truck... We see VA7000 chipset content goes to $100/car (ASP $5/chip, two chips/link, and 10 links/car). ~100M cars, we est. a $10B TAM opportunity. A-PHY reduces overall system cost by 15% vs. competing SerDes solutions. We expect VLN to announce two additional A-PHY design wins by mid-’23. We like the emergent VLN growth story,” Schafer opined. In-line with an opportunity like this, Schafer rates Valens shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with a price target of $8 pointing toward a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Overall, we’re looking at a tech firm with 3 positive analyst reviews supporting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Valens has a current trading price of $5.69 and its $8.33 average price target suggests a 46% upside by the end of this year. (See VLN stock forecast ) Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL) We’ll warp up with Marvell Technology, another leader in the automotive semiconductor chipset industry. In addition to cars, Marvell’s chips have found applications in data centers, especially in server functions, ethernet networks, and storage accelerators. The company’s chips are also used in SSD controllers. All of this is big business, and Marvell, with its $33 billion market cap, shows that in its financial results. The last reported quarter was 3Q of fiscal year 2023, and Marvell’s top line came in at $1.53 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Drilling down, we find that the revenue total supported several other positive metrics, including a GAAP net income of $13 million, or 2 cents per share ? a solid turnaround from the GAAP loss of $62 million in the year-ago quarter. In non-GAAP measures, Marvell reported net income of $492 million, for a diluted EPS of 57 cents. the company saw $411 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Even though Marvell has reported sound financial results, MRVL shares have seen a twelve-month loss of 47%. In his coverage of this stock, Oppenheimer’s Schafer takes a bullish line, writing, “MRVL remains positioned for diverse, structural growth led by cloud, 5G, and auto. A top pick, we remain long-term buyers."""" Schafer maintains his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Marvell, and his price target, at $70, indicates his confidence in ~80% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Big Tech gets plenty of Wall Street attention ? and unsurprisingly, Marvell has 21 recent analyst reviews on record. These break down 20 to 1 favoring the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading at $39 and their $62.52 average price target implies a 60% upside for the coming year.

2023-01-20,FUV,"While the post-pandemic new normal sparked dramatic interest in the electric vehicle segment, not every participant will likely perform well due to issues like consolidation. Tellingly, the recent dramatic enthusiasm around some highly-shorted EV stocks ? in particular, the tickers ARVL and FUV (before its major fall this week) ? appears divorced from fundamentals, warranting extreme caution. I am bearish on both stocks. Nevertheless, the fact that bullishness toward EV stocks exists isn’t a surprising result. For one thing, the entire sector suffered cataclysmic damage in 2022. From a purely speculative angle, the red ink may offer a discounted opportunity. On a broader level, the benchmark CPI report aligned with expectations, indicating that inflation cooled again in December. Logically, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may be less aggressive with its monetary policy, going forward. Moreover, some EV stocks generated such intense bearishness that contrarian traders are willing to take the opposite side of the wager in the hopes of sparking a short squeeze. Essentially, bidding up heavily-shorted shares sparks tremendous pressure among bears, who must return the securities they borrowed to initiate a short position. Thus, by forcing “negative” traders to blink first, the bulls can enjoy massive rewards. As TipRanks reporter Vince Condarcuri mentioned, short-squeeze attempts can burn pessimists targeting the most embattled of organizations. Still, the trade isn’t as easy as it looks. If it was, everybody would be doing it. In the case of the below EV stocks, most investors should probably steer clear. Arrival (ARVL) A British EV manufacturer, Arrival ( NASDAQ:ARVL ) primarily focuses on lightweight commercial vehicles, and at the moment, ARVL features a short interest of 22.84% of its float (float refers to the number of shares available to trade). If an investor was looking at EV stocks strictly during this year so far, Arrival would stand head and shoulders above the competition. Year-to-date, the stock is up 150% and was much higher just a few days ago. Of course, just looking at two weeks’ worth of price action would be incredibly deceptive. Should one examine the trailing-year performance, sobriety would immediately materialize, with ARVL falling nearly 90%. A few token swings higher just don’t make up for prior severe losses. Fundamentally, competition and, specifically, consolidation represent some of the biggest headwinds for Arrival. Considering both the longer-term and near-term history of the automotive industry, it’s clear that the world doesn’t need that many manufacturers. Over time, EV stocks risk being swallowed whole, with the big dogs dominating the sector. Financially, Arrival’s main claim to fame is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.4 times, this metric ranks above 67% of the competition. Otherwise, Arrival remains an aspirational, pre-revenue enterprise that continues to lose money. It’s worth reminding everyone that its retained losses stand at nearly $1.7 billion. Is ARVL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, ARVL stock has a Hold rating based on just one Hold rating. Unfortunately, the stock does not have a price target from the one analyst. Arcimoto (FUV) Headquartered in Eugene, Oregon, Arcimoto ( NASDAQ:FUV ) specializes in what it terms the Fun Utility Vehicle, hence the ticker symbol. A tandem two-seat, three-wheeled EV, Arcimoto’s FUV certainly appears fun to operate. Notably, the stock sports a short interest of 25.9% of its float, making it highly shorted. Better yet, contrarian traders finally decided to take the company out for a spin (until an incident occurred). While not nearly as impressive as Arrival above, Acrimoto certainly held its own temporarily. Last week, FUV gained nearly 32%. At the time, with EV stocks taking a beating in 2022, embattled stakeholders welcomed the sentiment reversal. Unfortunately, the broader narrative changed dramatically earlier this week. According to a report from Electrek, in a last-ditch effort to raise funding, Arcimoto “announced the sale of $12 million in stock at just $3 per share.” Predictably, this action cratered FUV stock. After starting the new year so auspiciously, it’s now down 27%. Financially, it’s difficult to imagine how Arcimoto digs its way out of the hole. About the only conspicuous positive is that the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 170.3%. However, this status will likely change as Arcimoto now struggles against bankruptcy. Therefore, it’s best not to play with FUV and steer well clear of it. Is FUV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, FUV stock has a Hold consensus rating based one Buy, zero Holds, and one Sell rating. The average FUV price target is $10.00, implying 340.53% upside potential. The Takeaway: Some EV Stocks Might Not Make It Although EV stocks represent one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street, the reality is that not everyone in the space will make it. Even with economies of scale, the segment features big-ticket purchases. Therefore, only a few manufacturers have the right stuff to survive.
